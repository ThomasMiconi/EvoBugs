Enormous EatBonus, because the exponential decay require it to extend life time by any significant amount... Also slower enery decay, and higher fightE, SpeedE

Now some clear divergences in pedigrees... mostly between some apparent 'immortals' with very short pedigrees and everyone else...
r classes of individuals: sessile individuals with no motion or aggro, and highly-mobile, high-aggro individuals. Not clear if the immortals are former or latter.

Yes, the immortals are the high-mobility, high-aggro.
Massive lotkerra-volta cycles? "immortals" at one point majority, crash to small minority, the rest of the population re-expands...

Possibility that 'sens-other' guided predators do emerge, but are so efficient that they basically almost-destroy the population - and themselves?...

Eventually the strong diversity dies out and all lineages converge (at least to 30 generations). But still some diversity...

 Big swings in population size, by factor of 5 or more..
 
Diversity is re-created after homogenization - the high-aggro, high-mobility phenotype is so useful it re-appears, and diversity resurfaces... then population crashes again!

java World VISUAL 1 SEED 5 FIGHTENERGY .03 EATBONUS 100000.0 FIGHTDAMAGE 4.0 SPEEDENERGY .02 ENERGYDECAY .998 WSIZE 2005 > tmp28.txt leads to durable, self-recreating diversity. With exclsense!

The final, long-term situation is mostly sessile individuals, with a few
looping, high-aggro individuals (with or without 'hiccups'). Why do they not
use sesnor-other to just zero-in on the sessile ones? There seems to be a lot
of sensor-others, though always in the minority - are loopers sensor-other?...

Without exclsens, java World VISUAL 1 SEED 5 FIGHTENERGY .03 EATBONUS 2000.0 FIGHTDAMAGE 4.0 SPEEDENERGY .01 ENERGYDECAY .998 WSIZE 2005 > out.txt leads to convergence to single type (though with some complexity?)

Trying java World VISUAL 1 SEED 5 FIGHTENERGY .03 EATBONUS 100000.0 FIGHTDAMAGE 4.0 SPEEDENERGY .02 ENERGYDECAY .998 WSIZE 2005 >  out.txt (same that workd to produce diversity with exclsens...) devolves into all-sessile!
Hmm, so the excl-sens was crucial in variety?...


NOTE: in a separate experiment (close), setting Eatbonu to zero, there were still a lot of aggro!... Benefits of aggro even without eating? As defense against unavoidable stray aggro, or as "spite"?...
